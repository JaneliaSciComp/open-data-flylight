# FlyLight Alignment Templates

Part of the [Janelia FlyLight Imagery](https://open.quiltdata.com/b/janelia-flylight-imagery) open data set.

This bucket contains processed templates for registering images to standard alignment spaces. The [original source templates](https://www.janelia.org/open-science/jrc-2018-brain-templates) were published in [Bogovic, et. al](https://doi.org/10.1101/376384). These versions are optimized for alignment of FlyLight's data.
