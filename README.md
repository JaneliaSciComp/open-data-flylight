# FlyLight/FlyEM Open Data Imagery

This repository contains static files for FlyLight's AWS Open Data. These folder are mirrored on S3 with each top-level folder corresponding to a public bucket:
* [janelia-flylight-imagery](janelia-flylight-imagery/README.md)
* [janelia-flylight-templates](janelia-flylight-templates/README.md)
* [janelia-flylight-color-depth](janelia-flylight-color-depth/README.md)
This repository also contains programs for uploading data.

## Implementation notes

* The Markdown used in this repo contains footnotes, which are [not supported by Github](https://github.com/github/markup/issues/498), so they will not render correctly in the Github preview. The actual publication target for these README's is [Quilt](https://open.quiltdata.com/b/janelia-flylight-imagery) which does support footnotes.
